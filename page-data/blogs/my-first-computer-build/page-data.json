I was fortunate to work with colleagues that had unique interests. Ranging from photography, graphic design, gaming, all the way to music production, I had a resource hub. Exploring many of those interests, the one that intimidated me the most was building computers. To physically assemble components one by one seemed laborious and I believed that I was too inexperienced. I was not ready for this daunting project.</p>\n<p>It wasn't till a friend of mines at work named Thanh introduced me to his PC builds. He explained the process and provided resources for me to learn and find my components for a reasonable price. Once he told me that he would help me build when I am ready, I literally felt like I had zero execute to not build.</p>\n<p>I wanted a custom build, but I did not want to rush the process and I certainly did not want be cheap about my build. I wanted something of high quality and performance. When I worked at Geek Squad, I asked a million questions to learn and understand the art of building. </p>\n<p>For years, I‚Äôve had a plan. I even held on to parts for as long as two years (I got those components for half price, so I purchased them early even though I was not ready).</p>\n<p>Finally, I invested into myself and purchased all the parts and built my computer for the first time. Doing things for the first time is special, so I recorded the experience. Watch, thumbs up, comment, share, and most importantly experience the process with me. </p>\n<p>Thank you üåê</p>\n<h1>BUILD PROCESS</h1>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ok1qyZ-equs?rel=0\" frameBorder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowFullScreen></iframe></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://pcpartpicker.com/user/codeherk/saved/TfMnLk\"><strong>PCPARTSPICKER PARTS LIST</strong></a></li>\n<li>\n<p>Youtube Video detailing each component along with price (below)</p>\n<!-- <div>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ok1qyZ-equs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div> -->\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>RESOURCES</h1>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.pcpartpicker.com/\">PCPARTSPICKER</a></h3>\n<p>This website made the process ridiculously easier.
