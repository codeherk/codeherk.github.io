# INTRO
Whenever I've heard stories about PC builds, I got excited and hoped that not only will I be able to afford to build one, but I will have the courage to even attempt to do it. 

Working at Best Buy over the years, I was exposed to technology from every angle. I was fortunate to work with colleagues that had unique interests. Ranging from photography, graphic design, gaming, all the way to music production, I had a resource hub. Exploring many of those interests, the one that intimidated me the most was building computers. To physically assemble components one by one shied me away. 

It wasn't till a friend of mines at work named Thanh introduced me to his PC build(s). He explained the process and provided resources for me to learn and find my components for a reasonable price. Once he told me that he would help me build when I am ready, I literally felt like I had zero execute to not build.

I wanted a custom build, but I did not want to rush to process and I certainly did not want be cheap about my build. I wanted something of high quality and performance. When I worked at Geek Squad, I asked a million questions to learn and understand the art of building. 

For years, I‚Äôve had a plan. I even held on to parts for as long as two years (I got those components for half price, so I purchased them early even though I was not ready).

Finally, I invested into myself and purchased all the parts and built my computer for the first time. Doing things for the first time is special, so I recorded the experience. Watch, thumbs up, comment, share, and most importantly experience the process with me. 

Thank you üåê
