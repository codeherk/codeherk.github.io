# CODING
Each website are typically composed with these three
- HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
Used to create the structure of the site.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
Describes how HTML elements should be displayed. CSS code can be stored in it’s own file (external) or in the HTML file (inline).
- JS (JavaScript). 
Programs the behavior of web pages.

# DOMAINS
A domain name is your website name. It identifies a network domain or an IP address, which is the address used to access the internet or a server computer hosting a website.
Domains names are used to establish a unique identity. It is common for companies to have domain names that correspond to their name (ex. Google & Google.com).

Here’s a few sites where you can purchase a domain (Do your research!):
- [Godaddy](Godaddy.com)
- [Hostgator](Hostgator.com)
- [Namecheap](Namecheap.com)
- [Google Domains](domains.google.com)

**IP address**: a numeric address that is assigned to network hardware (computer, printer, router, etc.) This helps in connecting one network hardware to other devices, which enables communication between them.


# HOSTING
Web hosting is a service that allows one to post a website / webpage on the World Wide Web (aka the Internet). Companies that offer web hosting (Web hosts) have dedicated servers where site files are stored. When you type in the domain name URL in the browser, your computer sends a request (HTTP) to the server and the webpages are served to you through your browser window. Some of the sites that offer domains also offer hosting!

# WEBSITE BUILDERS
These website builders are normally all-in-one solutions that handle not only the construction of a website, but the hosting as well. This really appeals to consumers who want a website built quickly while still being affordable. Those who are eager can even build it themselves as most solutions don't require any coding.

The following offer these solutions:
- [Wordpress](Wordpress.com)
- [Wix](Wix.com)
- [SquareSpace](squarespace.com)
- [Shopify](shopify.com)
- [BigCartel](bigcartel.com)
