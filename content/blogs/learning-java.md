# VARIABLES
Variables are reserved memory locations to store values. When you create a variable, you are reserving some space in memory. Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates a specific amount of memory and decides what can be stored in it.

# CONDITIONALS
Conditional statements check whether a specified condition is true or false. It determines what event happens next.

# LOOPS
Lines of code are executed in a sequential order.
Loops allow you to execute lines of code repeatedly until a specified condition is reached.

QUESTION: This code block executed how many times?

# FUNCTIONS
A function is a block of organized, reusable code.v
Python has built-in functions like print(), but you can create your own.
When printSum() is called, it executes the instructions in the defined code block.

Is there such a thing as 
over-commenting?  
What other data types do you know?
